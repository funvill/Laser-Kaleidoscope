# Math Clock

A large one meter wooden circle with ninety-six servos evenly places around the edge of the circle. On the top of each servo is a line laser pointer (vertical plastic Fresnel lens).  Each the loop, the servos are moved so that a fractal pattern forms from the laser lines on the circle. 

The fractal patterns are based off times tables of the Mandelbrot set as described in this video “Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics” by “Mathologer” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8. An interactive animation of these fractals  can be found here http://entibo.fr/timesTables/ 

ToDo

- Choose a better name. math clock is not the most inspiring name. 
- Do a better intro so all the art geeks will like me.
